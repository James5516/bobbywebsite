<h4>
I am trying to raise the money for a school trip to Africa, this trip will consist of travelling around Tanzania and most importantly helping tribes and learning about there culture and ways of living.
While we are there we are helping the tribes with their ways of lives. I think this would be a great experience and allow me to help some people that have such an amazing life without the luxury's that I have here in the UK.
