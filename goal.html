I am trying to raise the money for a school trip to Africa, this trip will consist of travelling around Tanzania and most importantly helping tribes and learning about there culture and ways of living.
While we are there we are helping the tribes with their ways of lives. I think this would be a great experience and allow me to help some people that have such an amazing life without the luxury's that I have here in the UK.

My goal is to raise enough money to be able to go on this trip, It is a personal ambition of mine to try and help as many people as possible and make a difference.
I will be trying to raise money through Fundraising events and doing jobs. At the bottom of the page there is a contact me section where I will be happy to answer questions.
I will keep this website updated with news of events to hopefully raise the money I need.
